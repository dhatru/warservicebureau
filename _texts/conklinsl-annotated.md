To have known Sherman was to have loved him, and this we all did and,we think, he returned our affection, so that we also have suffered a great loss. Sherman's unfailing good nature, his ready sympathy and his eagerness to be always doing something for someone else, were <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="'In January 1918, he was awarded the Croix de Guerre for saving the life of a comrade whose clothing had been set on fire by an explosion of gasoline.

Immediately after his release, he returned to duty, performing brave and splendid service until he met his death at the village of Montgobert.' | From: Silvers, E. R. Obituaries

In all the time we have known "Cub”, as we called him, not one of us ever heard him say one word in anger _noe_ [sic] express even one unkind thought of anyone. Indeed, the memory of his great heart and larger nature will always remain one of our most cherished possessions.

Our sorrow and our loss are too great to be conveyed in words, but we want you to know how much we loved Sherman, and that we can never forget him. We shall be always guided by the example he set us, and when we most miss him, we shall try to remember that his call found him ready and unafraid to answer, and that he gave his life in the greatest work of this great cause, the relief of pain and torture.

If we could be of any service at all to you, please let us know.

<p class="left">Dear <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Conklin, Elizabeth | Born: 1852. Died: 19--.
Mother.">Mrs. Conklin</button>,</p>

 We are anxious to have <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Conklin, Sherman | Born: 1894. Died: 1918.
Private.">Sherman</button>'s picture in the October issue of the <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="The first incarnation of what is now the Rutgers Magazine  | From: Rutgers University Libraries"> <a href="https://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/alumni/rutgers_magazine">RUTGERS ALUMNI QUARTERLY</a> </button> together with a full account of his life and death. We shall be very grateful if you will send us a photograph of him; also whatever details you may have about his death. perhaps a letter or two from his comrades, or a letter from Sherman himself. Everything will be well taken care of and returned to you undamaged within a week of its receipt. 

 Sherman's death was a big shock to his many friends at the college. His life was so full of promise that it seemed wrong, somehow, to have it cut off so abruptly. But it must be a world of comfort to you to have hod such a son. I am sure that he died with a smile on his lips, and with the knowledge that he had not made so splendid a sacrifice in vain. We Rutgers men are very proud of him. 

<p class="indent-1">Very sincerely yours,</p>
<br>

<p class="left">Dear Mrs.Conklin</p>

I would gladly send you fifty copies of the October issue of the Quarterly if we had them, but calls have been so frequent and many that there are only twenty left. For college records and filing purposes, we should really have more than that number. 

I think, however, that by dropping a line to a few of <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Conklin, Sherman L. | Born: 1894. Died: 1918.
Private, Ambulence Corps.">Sherman</button>’s classmates, I can gather a few extra copies together. Under separate cover I am mailing you six.

Please do not bother about their cost. I am very sorry that I cannot send you a great many more.

Just as soon as things are straightened out here at the college, I shall take up the matter of collecting <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Conklin wrote poetry and prose for the Field Service Bulletin (published by the American Field Service in Paris).
