<p class="left"> My dear Mrs. Cubberley:—</p>

 I am very sorry that I have neglected to return <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Cubberley, Chester C. | Born: 1897. Died: 1918.
Cadet, Navel Reserve Force.">Chester's</button> picture and letter to you. I did not know that there was any immediate desire for it and I have not given it the attention which it should have had. I am sending you now under separate cover both the picture and letter but I am afraid that the rush of Christmas season will not permit your receiving it by Wednesday. However, I sincerely hope that you do get it in time. 

I am also sending you the <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Probably a getatin dry plate, regarded as a practical improvement upon the collodion negative process.

I thank you very much for your good Christmas wishes.
