<p class="left">Dear Mrs. Cubberley:</p>

I have pictures and biographies of all our Rutgers men who have died in the service with the exception of your son <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Cubberley, Chester C. | Born: 1897. Died: 1918.
Cadet, Naval Reserve Force.">Chester</button>. From him I have a letter sent from <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="New Orleans, LA"><a href='https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=29_56_59_N_90_1_45_W'>New Orleans</a> </button> on July 31st but we are very anxious to have a complete record _or_ [sic] our war heroes and would be grateful for your cooperation. May we have his picture and any facts concerning him which you would care to have printed in the <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="The first incarnation of the Rutgers Magazine. It ran from October 1914 to July 1921. | From: Special Collections and University Archives, Rutgers University Libraries"> <a href="https://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/alumni/rutgers_magazine">Rutgers Alumni Quarterly</a> </button>:

 Here at College we thought a good deal of Chester and we wish to pay proper tribute to him for his sacrifice.

<p class="left">Dear Mr. Duncombe:</p>

I have written twice to his mother in <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="44 South Fifth Avenue, Long Branch, NJ"><a href='https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=40_17_43_N_73_59_23_W'>Long Branch</a> </button> asking her for <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Silvers is often asking for pictures so that he can publish them in the Rutgers Alumni Quarterly."> <a href="">his picture</a> </button> and for a brief sketch of his life, but have received no reply. It is very desirous that we have these things in order to keep our college war records complete and I am calling on you to ask if you might not aid us in the matter. Mrs. Cubberly lives at 44 South 5th Avenue ,Long Branch. If you will take the time to visit her and ask her if we may not have the things I have requested, we shall be deeply grateful for your kindness. I am hoping to have the material on hand when the Alumni Quarterly goes to press on October 10th.

<p class="indent-1">Thanking you for whatever service you may be able to render, I am
 Very sincerely yours,</p>
