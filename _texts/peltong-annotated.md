 The monthly War Service letters have been arriving regularly, and they certainly are a great institution. When one reads of the important part Rutgers men are taking in world events, the ivy covered walls of <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Old Queens, New Brunswick, NJ"><a href='https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=40_29_55.5_N_74_26_46.5_W'>old Queens</a> </button> form a mental image dear to his heart.

 I dislike to cause you unnecessary trouble, but I should appreciate it very much if you were to mail me a list of Rutgers men who are commissioned in any branch of the Engineers, <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="'A branch of the armed forces dealing with the supply and storage of weapons, ammunition, and related equipment' | From: New Oxford American Dictionary"> <a href="">Ordnance</a> </button>, Aircraft Production or Quartermaster Corps, with their addresses so far as known.

 I am sorry that I am not able to send you the list of commissioned officers as suggested in your letter of August 26th. We have not such a list in type at the present time. We are short of clerical help just now and it is not possible for us to give the time to such work. 

 I thank you for your interest and wish you success in the line of work you have undertaken. 

<p class="indent-1">Very truly yours,</p>
