In all the time we have known "Cub”, as we called him, not one of us ever heard him say one word in anger _noe_ [sic] express even one unkind thought of anyone. Indeed, the memory of his great heart and larger nature will always remain one of our most cherished possessions.

Our sorrow and our loss are too great to be conveyed in words, but we want you to know how much we loved Sherman, and that we can never forget him. We shall be always guided by the example he set us, and when we most miss him, we shall try to remember that his call found him ready and unafraid to answer, and that he gave his life in the greatest work of this great cause, the relief of pain and torture.

If we could be of any service at all to you, please let us know.

<p class="left">Dear Mrs.Conklin</p>

I would gladly send you fifty copies of the October issue of the Quarterly if we had them, but calls have been so frequent and many that there are only twenty left. For college records and filing purposes, we should really have more than that number. 

I think, however, that by dropping a line to a few of <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Conklin, Sherman L. | Born: 1894. Died: 1918.

Please do not bother about their cost. I am very sorry that I cannot send you a great many more.

Just as soon as things are straightened out here at the college, I shall take up the matter of collecting <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Conklin wrote poetry and prose for the Field Service Bulletin (published by the American Field Service in Paris).
