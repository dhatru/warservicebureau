Director, War Service Bureau.">Reed</button>:</p>

I received your letter and am glad to hear that you and "friend" are at the shore. It will do you both lots of good. Thank "friend" for the postal. It is very nice that you have a chance to get a commission but hold off and stay where you are. There are plenty to do the work.

I had to run out just then and take a look at an aeroplane passing over the barracks — a big flying boat affair only about 500 feet up.

<p class="small centered"> - Page: 4 - </p>


We see all kinds of interesting sights every day — new flying machine, search lights, boats and men of war.

The work continues just about the same. We plug on geometry, trig, and physics; play war games, drill on the guns, attend lectures, _snatch [?]_ half an hours swim and wait for Sunday and rest to come.

The hard thing is not being able to see home or any of you there. There is not the excitement of <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Fort Myer, VA"><a href='https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=38_52_54_N_77_4_58_W'>Fort
                  Myer</a> </button> here and that is what makes things go harder. The kind of work we have to me however more than compensates for the grind.

 If we go to France it will 

<p class="small centered"> - Page: 5 - </p>


be with heavy field and *seige* [sic] guns. Some of us will probably be there by fall. Don't tell anyone about that however. It would scare my aunt to death. She thinks that none of us will ever leave the country.

Give my best to the "gang" Tell _Dave [?]_ that I will write him soon but not to wait for me to do that little thing.

<p class="indent-1">Wishing you best of luck in that which you decide to do. In the bonds,</p>

I have not heard yet whether they captured anything. The first taste of war.

<p class="small centered"> - Page: 8 - </p>


We finished our work on the big guns and are starting on the smaller ones which is much less exciting but necessary nevertheless.

I have had a couple of good suppers at <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="The Chamberlin Hotel, on the property of Fort Monroe, catered to both tourists and officers.

 I find in making arrangements for disposing of my estate in case anything happens to me that I have a couple of rather valuable instruments and one very valuable book that I would like to leave to the <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Rutgers College, New Brunswick, NJ"><a href='https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=40_30_2_N_74_26_50_W'>College</a> </button> as I think they would be used and appreciated there more than anywhere else.

 These are: One _microscope [?]_ with several rather fine English made 
<p class="small centered"> - Page: 10 - </p>

 lenses and French slides which I think are of biological subjects; One astronomical instrument built like a sextant very old and probably an antique but probably of some service; a book which was written in 1662 (or published at that time) about science in general and a reference in it about communication by magnetic attraction which is quite singular. 

 If you think these things are or would be in order just drop me a quiet line.

## William P. E. Ainsworth to Earl Reed Silvers, June 7, 1918


<p class="small centered"> - Page: 17 - </p>


<p class="right">Somewhere in France. June 7, 1918</p>

<p class="left">Dear Reed:</p>

At last I am "over here" and everything is so peaceful in the locality where I am situated that it hardly seems I am in a country which has been at war for four years. Of course I am in a place very many miles from the firing line which accounts for the tranquility. You must understand, while I censor my own mail, that I cannot reveal many things and must deal largely in generalities in writing you. 

<p class="small centered"> - Page: 18 - </p>


<p class="centered small">[2]</p> ( First of all I want to enquire for "friend—wife" and "Mike" I hope both are as well as ever and suppose "Mike" is growing everyday. Tickle him for me. ) 

The trip over was wonderful. The sea was very calm and the weather beautiful all the way over except for about two days when it blew up rather rough and as the seas caught us sideways the boat rocked to beat the band. It sometimes rocked so that for hours if you were sitting on deck you were looking alternatively at the sky above and the water beneath you and unless you braced your steamer chair you would slide, chair and all across the deck. Many of the men were dreadfully seasick but it did not effect me in the least, in fact I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I have often heard what 
<p class="small centered"> - Page: 19 - </p>

<p class="centered small">[3]</p> a wonderful sight land is after days at sea but never realized is until I saw it at the end of our voyage.

 Of our debarking and train trip I may say little except that the scenery was wonderful but in a different way from America. Our beautiful sections as a rule are the wild ones but the beautiful sections of France are after the cultivated ones.

At present our company is billetted in an old French estate surrounded by vineyards. The officers live in the chateau which is a great white stone house with a tile roof (one of the originals from which the millionnaires take their plans for their seaside homes)

I have a nice big room with an adjoining second floor parlour. In back there is a terrace with a 
<p class="small centered"> - Page: 20 - </p>

 palm and rose garden containing a wonderful pagoda. A brook with a deep curving hole runs thru a nearby meadow and affords the men an opportunity for bathing. The days are very warm and the nights cool.

What more could one ask for?

I am very well and very happy and, I believe, very fortunate.

I will write in the near future and want you to do that little thing very often.

Don't forget the letters from College and the Quarterly.
